# Expected Response:
# Status: 200 OK
# {
#   "success": true,
#   "message": "Password reset instructions sent to your email",
#   "data": null
# }
```

**Verification Steps:**
1. ‚úÖ Check server console logs for: `OTP email sent successfully to test@example.com`
2. ‚úÖ Check email inbox or email service logs for OTP delivery
3. ‚úÖ Verify OTP is 6 digits and in database with 5-minute expiry
4. ‚úÖ Check database: `db.otps.find({"email": "test@example.com"})`

#### **Test 2: Reset Password with Valid OTP (Success)**
```bash
# Step 2: Use OTP to reset password (replace 123456 with actual OTP)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/reset-password \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "email": "test@example.com",
  "otp": "123456",
  "newPassword": "newSecurePassword123"
}'

# Expected Response:

# }
```

**Verification Steps:**
1. ‚úÖ Check server logs for: `Password reset successful for user: test@example.com`
2. ‚úÖ Verify OTP is deleted from database after use
3. ‚úÖ Test login with new password
4. ‚úÖ Verify old password no longer works

#### **Test 3: Invalid OTP (Failure)**
```bash

### Session Deletion Testing

#### **Setup: Create Test Data**
```bash
# 1. Create a client user
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/signup \

-d '{
  "name": "Test Client",
  "email": "client@test.com",
  "password": "password123",
  "dateOfBirth": "1990-01-01"
}'

# 2. Get client token from response, then create a workout session
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/workout-sessions \
-H "Authorization: Bearer CLIENT_TOKEN_HERE" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "title": "Test Workout Session",
  "description": "Test session for deletion",
  "startTime": "2025-08-30T10:00:00.000Z",
  "endTime": "2025-08-30T12:00:00.000Z"

# Save the session ID from response for testing
```

#### **Test 1: Client Delete Own Scheduled Session (Success)**
```bash
# Client deletes their own scheduled session
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:3000/api/workout-sessions/SESSION_ID_HERE \

# Expected Response:
# Status: 200 OK
# {
#   "success": true,
#   "message": "Workout session deleted successfully",
#   "data": null
# }
```

**Verification Steps:**
1. ‚úÖ Check session status changed to 'cancelled' in database
2. ‚úÖ Verify `isDeleted` field set to `true`
3. ‚úÖ Session no longer appears in client's session list

#### **Test 2: Client Try to Delete Other's Session (Failure)**
```bash
# Create another client and try to delete first client's session
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:3000/api/workout-sessions/OTHER_CLIENT_SESSION_ID \

# Expected Response:
# Status: 403 Forbidden
# {
#   "success": false,
#   "statusCode": 403,
#   "message": "Workout session not found or unauthorized"
# }
```

#### **Test 3: Client Try to Delete Past Session (Failure)**
```bash
# Try to delete a session that has already started/ended

### Cron Job Testing

#### **Test 1: OTP Cleanup Verification**
```bash

curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/forgot-password \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"email": "test1@example.com"}'

curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/forgot-password \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"email": "test2@example.com"}'

# 2. Check database
# MongoDB: db.otps.countDocuments()
# Should show 2 documents

# 3. Wait 10+ minutes and check logs
# Should see: "[CRON] Cleaned X expired OTP records"

# 4. Check database again
# MongoDB: db.otps.countDocuments()
# Should show 0 documents (expired ones cleaned up)
```

#### **Test 2: Manual Cron Trigger (Development)**
```bash
# In Node.js console or test script:
const { cleanExpiredOTPs } = require('./cron/jobs/cleanOTPs');
await cleanExpiredOTPs();
```

---

### Email System Testing

#### **Test 1: Email Configuration Verification**
```bash
# Test email configuration
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/health/email \
-H "Authorization: Bearer ADMIN_TOKEN_HERE"

# Or check in application startup logs for:
# "Email configuration is valid"
```

#### **Test 2: OTP Email Template Verification**
- ‚úÖ Email should have professional design with gym branding
- ‚úÖ OTP should be clearly displayed in large font
- ‚úÖ Should include security warning about unauthorized requests
- ‚úÖ Should have 5-minute expiration notice

#### **Test 3: Session Cancellation Email Verification**
- ‚úÖ Email should include session details (title, date, time)
- ‚úÖ Should explain reason for cancellation
- ‚úÖ Should provide contact information for questions
- ‚úÖ Should have professional styling with red theme for cancellation

---

### Validation Testing

#### **Test 1: Invalid Input Formats**
```bash
# Invalid email format
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/forgot-password \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"email": "invalid-email"}'

# Expected: 400 Bad Request - "Please provide a valid email address"

# Invalid OTP format (not 6 digits)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/reset-password \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "email": "test@example.com",
  "otp": "12345",
  "newPassword": "newpass123"
}'

# Expected: 400 Bad Request - "OTP must be exactly 6 digits"

# Password too short
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/reset-password \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "email": "test@example.com",
  "otp": "123456",
  "newPassword": "123"
}'

# Expected: 400 Bad Request - "Password must be at least 6 characters long"
```

#### **Test 2: Missing Required Fields**
```bash
# Missing email
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/forgot-password \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{}'

# Missing OTP
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/reset-password \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "email": "test@example.com",
  "newPassword": "newpass123"
}'
```

---

### Performance & Load Testing

#### **Test 1: Rate Limiting**
```bash
# Send multiple requests quickly to test rate limiting
for i in {1..10}; do
  curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/forgot-password \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "test@example.com"}' &
done
wait

# Should see rate limiting after configured limit
```

#### **Test 2: Concurrent Session Deletion**
```bash
# Test multiple users deleting sessions simultaneously
# (Create multiple sessions and tokens first)
for i in {1..5}; do
  curl -X DELETE http://localhost:3000/api/workout-sessions/SESSION_${i}_ID \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer CLIENT_${i}_TOKEN" &
done
wait
```

---

### Database Verification Queries

```javascript
// MongoDB queries for verification

// 1. Check OTP records
db.otps.find().pretty()
db.otps.countDocuments()

// 2. Check expired OTPs
db.otps.find({"expiresAt": {"$lt": new Date()}})

// 3. Check workout sessions
db.workoutsessions.find({"isDeleted": true}).pretty()
db.workoutsessions.find({"status": "cancelled"}).pretty()

// 4. Check agenda jobs (cron)
db.agendaJobs.find().pretty()

// 5. Check user accounts
db.users.find({"email": "test@example.com"}).pretty()
```

---

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

#### **Issue 1: OTP Email Not Sent**
- ‚úÖ Check email configuration in environment variables
- ‚úÖ Verify SMTP credentials are correct
- ‚úÖ Check server logs for email sending errors
- ‚úÖ Test email config: `EmailService.verifyEmailConfig()`

#### **Issue 2: Cron Jobs Not Running**
- ‚úÖ Check if agenda is properly initialized
- ‚úÖ Verify MongoDB connection for agenda collection
- ‚úÖ Check process logs for cron job execution
- ‚úÖ Manually trigger: `agenda.now('clean expired otps')`

#### **Issue 3: Session Deletion Permission Issues**
- ‚úÖ Verify user role in JWT token
- ‚úÖ Check session ownership (clientId matches token user)
- ‚úÖ Ensure session status is 'scheduled' for client deletion
- ‚úÖ Verify session is in the future, not past

#### **Issue 4: Database Index Issues**
```javascript
// Ensure proper indexes exist
db.otps.getIndexes()
// Should include: {"expiresAt": 1} with expireAfterSeconds: 0

db.workoutsessions.getIndexes()
// Should include indexes on clientId, startTime, etc.
```
